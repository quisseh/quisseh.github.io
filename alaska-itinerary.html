        <h2>Alaska Itinerary</h2>
        <h3>A twelve-day adventure through Alaska</h3>
        <h4>Day 1 (2016-08-13)</h4>
        <p>We departed mid-afternoon on an 8-hour flight.</p>
        <p>
            Landed in <strong>Anchorage, Alaska</strong> on time. Ran downstairs to the
            <strong>Alamo</strong> desk to pick up our rental car. Fairly
            quick/painless process. Drove to the nearby <strong>Holiday Inn
            Express</strong> and checked in. Place was charming/clean, room
            seemed recently renovated.
        </p>
        <p>
            After settling in, we drove to <strong>Samurai Sushi</strong> for
            dinner. Decent vegetarian sushi, but excellent vegetable tempura and
            miso soup.
        </p>

             alt="alaska plane view mountain range">
        <h4>Day 2 (2016-08-14)</h4>
        <p>Drove to grocery store to get fruit/nuts/granola to take with us
            for hiking.</p>
        <p>
            Visited the <strong>Potter Marsh Bird Sanctuary</strong>. Crossed
            all of the boardwalk paths. Gorgeous views. Saw magpies for the
            first time. Found a small school of salmon swimming upstream.
        </p>
        <p>
            Drove to <strong>Kincaid Park</strong> for a short hike. On the way
            we saw a bull moose grazing alongside the highway. He was majestic.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hiking at <strong>Kincaid Park</strong> was pleasant/quiet. On the
            way back we saw a cow moose and her two calves. We were screaming.
            They were beautiful.
        </p>
        <p>
            Went to <strong>Moose's Tooth</strong> for dinner. Food smelled
            better than it tasted. Our roasted vegetable pizzas were covered in
            whole cloves of garlic. Wasn't worth the 45-minute wait.
        </p>
        <p>
            Walked off our dinner at the <strong>Tony Knowles Coastal Trail</strong>.
            Great views. Learned about the 1964 <strong>Alaska</strong>
            earthquake and the changes it made to the landscape. My wife slipped
            on a slick clay mound and nearly fell off a cliff.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another night at the <strong>Holiday Inn Express</strong>.
        </p>

             alt="alaska kincaid park forest mushroom">
        <h4>Day 3 (2016-08-15)</h4>
        <p>
            Got up early and headed northeast about 2 hours to the <strong>Matanuska
            Glacier</strong>. This was an entertaining drive; much of the
            winding highway runs along cliffsides with magnificent mountain
            views.
        </p>
        <p>
            Went on an all-day ice climbing trip with <strong>MICA Guides</strong>,
            which turned out to be an incredible experience. By the end of the
            day we had hiked 6 miles across the glacier and completed 4 climbs
            into deep crevasses/moulins. Our guide was fun/knowledgeable. Highly
            recommended.
        </p>
        <p>
            That evening we stayed at the <strong>Alpenglow</strong> campsite
            next door to <strong>MICA Guides</strong>. Tent was spacious, bed
            was comfy.

        <h4>Day 4 (2016-08-16)</h4>
        <p>Woke up with the sun.</p>
        <p>
            Short drive down the road to <strong>Glacier View Adventures</strong>
            for zip-lining over the <strong>Matanuska River</strong>. Took a
            small hike up to the platform, then went flying at 60 miles per hour
            over 250 feet in the air. Fantastic.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our next destination was <strong>Homer</strong>, so we started
            heading southwest toward the <strong>Kenai Peninsula</strong>.
            Stopped at <strong>Beluga Point</strong> about 2 hours in. Beautiful
            ocean views and a soft clay beach. Massive rocks to climb.
        </p>
        <p>
            4 hours later we were in <strong>Homer</strong>. Yet another
            gorgeous drive with panoramic views of the <strong>Gulf of Alaska</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most restaurants were closed by the time we got here, so we had to
            improvise. We tried <strong>Wasabi's</strong>. Sushi was
            tasteless/overpriced. Don't eat sushi there.
        </p>
        <p>
            Spent the night at the <strong>Driftwood Inn</strong>. Our room was
            about the size of a walk-in closet, had not been updated since the
            1970s, and smelled like cough medicine. Wouldn't recommend it.
        </p>

        <h4>Day 5 (2016-08-17)</h4>
        <p>
            A day to explore <strong>Homer</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Breakfast at <strong>Two Sisters Bakery</strong>. Had an excellent
            raspberry streusel bar. Went down to <strong>Bishops Beach</strong>,
            walked along the shore. Saw our first bald eagle.
            Handsome/distinguished.
        </p>
        <p>
            Went to the <strong>Alaska Islands &amp; Ocean Visitor Center</strong>.
            Walked through a fascinating exhibit on <strong>Alaska</strong>'s
            history, the native Aleutian people, and how fur trade, oil
            extraction, and war eradicated plant/animal life across the state.
        </p>
        <p>
            Drove to the lovely <strong>Homer Spit</strong>. Liveliest place we
            had seen in <strong>Alaska</strong>. Walked around the cute little
            shops. Skipped rocks into the bay. Views from this spot are
            unbelievable.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ate lunch at <strong>la baleine cafe</strong>. We both ordered THE
            SEASALT sandwich. If you go to <strong>Homer</strong>, you need to
            have this sandwich. For dinner we went to <strong>Vida's Thai Food</strong>.
            Had pineapple tofu vegetable stir-fry. Food was excellent.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another night at the <strong>Driftwood Inn</strong>.

        <h4>Day 6 (2016-08-18)</h4>
        <p>
            An early 3-hour drive around the <strong>Kenai Peninsula</strong> to
            <strong>Seward</strong>. Nice views of the deep blue <strong>Kenai
            River</strong> along the way.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Seward</strong> turned out to be our favorite city in <strong>Alaska</strong>.
            Lots to do/see, very walkable, and surrounded by mountains/bays.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fast breakfast at <strong>Sea Bean Cafe</strong>. Had the best
            oatmeal of our lives. Eat oatmeal here.
        </p>
        <p>
            Main event for the day was a 5-hour wildlife cruise with <strong>Major
            Marine Tours</strong>. This was a great time. They took us through
            <strong>Resurrection Bay</strong> and out to the <strong>Gulf of
            Alaska</strong>. We saw sea otters, bald eagles, puffins, sea
            lions, humpback whales, and a mountain goat. Dramatic cliffsides
            filled with evergreens. A clear view of <strong>Bear Glacier</strong>.
            Scenery was incredible.
        </p>
        <p>
            Went to <strong>Woody's Thai Kitchen</strong> for dinner. Had garlic
            tofu fried rice. Food was okay but greasier than it needed to be.
        </p>
        <p>
            Stayed at the <strong>Breeze Inn</strong>. Location was excellent,
            right in the middle of everything. Room was fine. Hotel
            receptionists were a bit nutty.
        </p>

        <h4>Day 7 (2016-08-19)</h4>
        <p>
            Early morning kayaking trip on <strong>Resurrection Bay</strong>
            with <strong>Kayak Adventures Worldwide</strong>. Kayaking was fun.
            Our guide was entertaining. We saw bald eagles and sea otters.
            Spotted a few porpoises following us. Stopped at a small beach and
            headed inland to find a gorgeous 90-foot waterfall.
        </p>
        <p>
            Spent the rest of the day exploring <strong>Seward</strong>. Walked
            around the little shops, marina, and rocky shore.
        </p>
        <p>
            Had lunch at <strong>Sea Bean Cafe</strong>. Dinner at <strong>Peking</strong>.
            This was, officially, the freshest, best-tasting Chinese food we
            have ever eaten. We both ordered tofu and mixed vegetables in a
            spicy peanut sauce. I'm afraid I will never have Chinese food quite
            like this again. I personally thanked the owner for our dinner.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another night at the <strong>Breeze Inn</strong>.
        </p>

        <h4>Day 8 (2016-08-20)</h4>
        <p>
            A day of hiking at the <strong>Kenai Fjords National Park</strong>.
            Just a short drive outside the <strong>Seward</strong> city center.
        </p>
        <p>
            First hiked up to <strong>Exit Glacier</strong>, which was a
            magnificent sight. Then went down to the outwash plain at the toe of
            the glacier: a series of meandering streams and frozen glacial silt.
            Everything was sparkling. Finally, we took the <strong>Harding
            Icefield Trail</strong> up the mountain. This was a steep hike,
            gaining about 1000 feet of elevation per mile. It took us through
            thick forests, sharp cliffsides, and a succession of waterfalls. We
            stopped a few miles in to take in the view.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next stop was <strong>Anchorage</strong>. About a 3-hour drive. Plan
            was to spend the night there and load up on food for our next
            destination: <strong>Denali National Park</strong>. We stayed at the
            <strong>Marriott</strong> in <strong>Downtown Anchorage</strong>.
            Our room was nice/clean with a fantastic view of the city.

        <h4>Day 9 (2016-08-21)</h4>
        <p>
            Bright and early with a 5-hour drive headed north to <strong>Denali</strong>.
            Don't get caught with low gas on this route; there's a 100-mile
            stretch with no gas stations. We made this mistake.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hiked at the lengthy <strong>Triple Lakes Trail</strong>. A bit
            tricky to find but worth the effort. About 9 miles running alongside
            3 beautiful consecutive lakes. Narrow winding paths lined with wild
            berry bushes; blueberries and lingonberries everywhere. Very
            relaxing walk.
        </p>
        <p>
            After the hike we checked in to the nearby <strong>Crow's Nest
            Cabins</strong>. Charming cabins lined up along a cliffside. Nice
            view, close to the park, and within walking distance of a number of
            shops/restaurants.
        </p>
        <p>
            Went to the <strong>Black Bear Coffee House</strong> and had a
            fantastic dinner. Ordered grilled vegetable tacos with rice and
            black beans on the side. Shocked at the massive portion size. Coffee
            is great too.
        </p>
        <p>Walked around the surrounding area before heading back to the

        <h4>Day 10 (2016-08-22)</h4>
        <p>
            Took the hotel shuttle over to the <strong>Denali Visitor Center</strong>.
            There are a number of neat exhibits here that delve into the
            geology/ecology of the park. Waited here for the <strong>Savage
            River Shuttle</strong> to take us further in.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the drive to <strong>Savage River</strong> we saw several caribou
            and incredible views. When we arrived, we headed for the <strong>Savage
            Alpine Trail</strong>. This was by far the best hike we went on. 4
            miles one way, 1500-foot elevation gain. Surprising variety of
            vibrant flora. Jagged cliffs inhabited by shouting arctic ground
            squirrels. At the first peak of the climb we finally caught a
            glimpse of <strong>Denali</strong>. We took a break, looking in
            every direction at the vastness of everything.
        </p>
        <p>From here the climb intensified. I had never before experienced
            crosswind so strong/persistent. I could lean my back against the
            wind and remain suspended. Each step required care to avoid being
            knocked over. This was an extraordinary feeling.</p>
        <p>
            Eventually we reached our limit and headed back satisfied. Paid
            another visit to the <strong>Black Bear Coffee House</strong> for
            dinner, then back to the <strong>Crow's Nest Cabins</strong> for the
            night.

        <h4>Day 11 (2016-08-23)</h4>
        <p>
            A third visit to the <strong>Black Bear Coffee House</strong>; this
            time for breakfast. Hummus bagels and coffee.
        </p>
        <p>
            Returned to <strong>Denali Visitor Center</strong> to stroll around
            the small trails in the area. Eventually made our way to the back
            end of <strong>Triple Lakes Trail</strong>. Immediately after
            crossing the bridge over <strong>Riley Creek</strong>, we froze; 15
            feet ahead of us, around a bend, was a grizzly bear digging up
            roots. Enormous, beautiful animal. Somehow we went unnoticed and
            were able to back away safely. Wish we could've spent some time
            quietly observing.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was time for a 5-hour drive south to <strong>Anchorage</strong>.
            Upon arrival, we returned the rental car to <strong>Alamo</strong>
            and checked in to the <strong>Holiday Inn Express</strong>. Ordered
            decent delivery food from <strong>China Garden</strong> and watched
            National Geographic until we fell asleep. Relaxing night.

        <h4>Day 12 (2016-08-24)</h4>
        <p>
            Early connecting flight with a stop in <strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>. We
            had a 3-hour layover and wanted to make the most of it. Sprinted to
            the <strong>Link light rail</strong> as soon as we landed and got
            on. Stopped at the <strong>Chinatown-International District</strong>.
            Explored for a bit, then found ourselves at <strong>Tsukushinbo</strong>,
            where we had some of the best sushi we had ever eaten. We ordered
            the Garden Roll and Crunchy Veggie Roll.
        </p>
        <p>Got back on the train, then ran to our gate just in time for the
            flight home.</p>

        <h4>Some closing comments</h4>
        <p>All restaurants mentioned above were able to accommodate a vegan
            diet (some with minor menu adjustments).</p>
        <p>Jeans/t-shirt/light jacket were appropriate attire for most
            weather we encountered. Only on mountains/glaciers did we need to
            put on heavier/waterproof layers.</p>
        <p>
            We drove a total of 24 hours across the great state of <strong>Alaska</strong>.
            Having quality driving music is important. We like Modest Mouse,
            especially <em>This Is a Long Drive for Someone with Nothing to
            Think About</em>.
