        <h2>Lo-Fi Fun with Bfxr</h2>
        <h3>A beginners tutorial on sound effects with Bfxr</h3>
        <p>Sound design doesn't have to be so scary for game developers.</p>
        <p>
            <a href="http://www.bfxr.net/">Bfxr</a> is a brilliant little tool
            (created by Stephen Lavelle aka <a href="http://www.increpare.com/">increpare</a>)
            that enables just about anyone to make sound effects for their
            games. It's also completely free to use.
        </p>
        <p>It manages to be simple enough to use for a complete beginner
            (like me), yet complex enough to satisfy the creative needs of a
            sound designer.</p>
        <p>
            I really enjoyed using it while making the sound effects for <a
                href="quisseh-and-mawia.html">quisseh&amp;mawia</a>, so I decided
            to write this beginners tutorial and share my experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            (Note that this tool produces lo-fi samples, which are probably best
            suited for retro style games. If you're looking for higher quality
            and a lot more freedom, you might want to give <a
                href="https://www.apple.com/mac/garageband/">GarageBand</a> or even
            <a href="https://www.propellerheads.se/products/reason/">Reason</a>
            a try.)
        </p>
        <h3>Getting started</h3>
        <p>This is Bfxr.</p>
        <img class="imagePadding" src="images/1-bfxr-synth.png"
             alt="bfxr synth application screenshot">
        <p>
            To access Bfxr, go to the Bfxr <a href="http://www.bfxr.net/">
            website</a>. From there, you can either run the tool in your
            browser, or download it as a standalone application for Mac or
            Windows. (I prefer the standalone version, since it holds onto all
            of your sound clips indefinitely.)
        </p>
        <p>
            Now when I first started, I clung to the upper-left corner of the
            screen and avoided all of the fancy buttons and levers down the
            middle. Here you're given plenty of options, many of which can be
            found useful for any type of game: <strong>Pickup/Coin</strong>, <strong>Laser/Shoot</strong>,
            <strong>Explosion</strong>, <strong>Powerup</strong>, <strong>Hit/Hurt</strong>,
            <strong>Jump</strong>, and <strong>Blip/Select</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you're not entirely sure what kind of sound you're looking for,
            just click the <strong>Randomize</strong> button until something
            catches your ear.
        </p>
        <p>
            As you're generating new sounds, you'll notice that you're building
            up a queue of sound clips on the lower-left corner of the screen.
            Click on any of them or press the <strong>Play</strong> button on
            the right side of the screen to play the selected sound. Compare and
            contrast to see which sounds you like best.
        </p>
        <h3>Getting into it</h3>
        <p>By now you've probably come up with a few sounds you really like,
            but they're just missing a little something.</p>
        <p>Well there are a few tweaking methods you can use to solve that
            problem.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mutating</li>
            <li>Changing wave types</li>
            <li>Nitty-gritty lever adjustments</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Mutating</h3>
        <p>
            Let's start with mutating. Clicking the <strong>Mutation</strong>
            button will produce a slightly altered version of the highlighted
            sound. Sometimes this is all you need to achieve your desired sound.
        </p>
        <p>
            (Note that repeatedly clicking the <strong>Mutation</strong> button
            will actually mutate already mutated versions of the original sound.
            To always create a mutation of the original, you will have to click
            on the original again before creating another mutation.)
        </p>
        <p>One suggestion: while you're mutating sounds, pay attention to the
            adjustments that are automatically being made to the levers down the
            middle of the screen. This will give you audible hints as to what
            each lever does. This is how I started making connections between
            different levers and different sounds, which can be really helpful
            if you want more control.</p>
        <h3>Changing wave types</h3>
        <p>Up next is changing wave types. Along the upper-middle section of
            the screen, you have a choice of 9 wave types. Selecting a different
            wave type can dramatically change your sound. Some are better suited
            for certain types of sound effects than others.</p>
        <p>Here are my thoughts on each of them.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Triangle</strong>: Seems to soften, neutralize, and tone
                down. I've had the most luck using this for making unintrusive menu
                sounds.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Sin</strong>: Louder and cleaner sounding than <strong>Triangle</strong>.
                Useful for any type of sound effect.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Square</strong>: More intense than <strong>Sin</strong>.
                More of a retro feel compared to the other options. Very well
                suited for jump sounds.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Saw</strong>: Never found a practical use for this. This
                just sounds like <strong>Square</strong> but dirtier.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Breaker</strong>: Almost indistinguishable from <strong>Triangle</strong>.
                Perhaps a bit cleaner.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Tan</strong>: This seems to ruin every sound I throw at
                it.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Whistle</strong>: Similar to <strong>Sin</strong> but
                with an additional, slightly muted wave playing in the background.
                Produces some interesting results. Good for laser sounds.
            </li>
            <li><strong>White</strong>: Harsh, piercing noise. Suitable for
                explosions or hit sounds, but I prefer <strong>Pink</strong>.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Pink</strong>: Less shrill than
                <sstrong>White</strong>,
                    with more depth. Every explosion sound I made with <strong>White</strong>
                    ended up sounding better in <strong>Pink</strong>.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Making changes here actually modifies the original sound itself; it
            does not create a new sound for you like mutating does. To save your
            changes, click <strong>Apply Synth</strong>. To undo your changes,
            click <strong>Revert Synth</strong>. You can also duplicate any of
            your sounds with <strong>Duplicate Synth</strong> (which can be
            useful when testing out a bunch of different effects).
        </p>
        <h3>Nitty-gritty lever adjustments</h3>
        <p>Finally, there are the nitty-gritty lever adjustments. These can
            be tough to understand at first, but once you have a grasp of them
            they can be very powerful.</p>
        <p>I'll discuss the ones I have found to be most useful.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Attack Time</strong>: Time from when the sound begins to
                when it reaches its first peak. Increase to make that period
                longer, decrease to make it shorter. Higher attack seems to lessen
                the effect of <strong>Punch</strong>.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Decay Time</strong>: Time taken for the sound to fall
                from its initial attack. Again, increasing makes this longer,
                decreasing makes it shorter.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Sustain Time</strong>: Time taken to sustain the sound
                once it is finished decaying. Increase to make longer, decrease to
                make shorter.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Punch</strong>: Turning this up gives the sound an
                immediate pop. Useful for shooting, explosion, or hit sounds.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Compression</strong>: Increasing this makes the entire
                sound stand out much more. Too much can compromise quality, though.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Frequency</strong>: Musical note your sound will begin
                at. Nudging this by .01 in either direction seems to increment or
                decrement your sound by one note.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Frequency Slide</strong>: Direction your sound will head
                in over time. A value of 0 will maintain a constant frequency (good
                for menus). Less than 0 means frequency will fall (good for
                shooting sounds). Greater than 0 means frequency will rise (good
                for jumping sounds).
            </li>
            <li><strong>Frequency Cutoff</strong>: Highest or lowest frequency
                your sound will reach as it changes over time. If you don't like
                the note your sound ends on, you can fix that here.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Vibrato Depth</strong>: Use in conjunction with <strong>Vibrato
                Speed</strong> to make your sound shiver (vibrate). Really useful
                for fancy laser sounds. (Turn both up past .5 to see what I mean.)
            </li>
            <li><strong>Square Duty</strong>: Changes the ratio of highs to lows
                on the <strong>Square</strong> wave. Use in conjunction with <strong>Duty
                    Sweep</strong> to change direction. (I like turning both down to
                their minimums for jumping sounds.)
            </li>
            <li><strong>Repeat Speed</strong>: Repeats your sound at various
                speeds. Good for lasers, sirens, and powerups.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Bit Crush</strong>: Creates a really unique sound
                through distortion. Use in conjunction with <strong>Bit Crush Sweep</strong>
                to change direction. You can make some outrageous explosions with
                this. Definitely worth playing around with.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>That should be more than enough to get you started.</p>
        <h3>Mixing</h3>
        <p>
            You can use mixing to combine multiple sounds into one clip. At the
            upper-middle section of the screen, select the <strong>Mixer</strong>
            tab.
        </p>
        <img class="imagePadding" src="images/1-bfxr-mixer.png"
             alt="bfxr mixer application screenshot">
        <p>From here you can select up to 5 sounds to combine. Choose your
            sounds from the drop down lists, then slide your sounds along the
            scale to the right to set the order. You can even set the volume of
            each individual sound.</p>
        <p>One of the nicest uses I've found for this is to concatenate
            sounds that would work well in sequence. For example, I can take the
            whistling sound of a bomb as it falls from the sky, and add an
            explosion sound to the end of it (which is what I did in the
            screenshot above).</p>
        <h3>Saving your masterpiece</h3>
        <p>You're probably done tweaking by now, so it's time to save your
            sound.</p>
        <p>
            To export your sound as a WAV file to use in your game, click the <strong>Export
            Wav</strong> button and save it to your local disk.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you plan on modifying your sound in Bfxr again at a later time,
            you can also click the <strong>Save to Disk</strong> button to save
            your sound in the bfxrsound format. Later on, you can go to <strong>Load
            from Disk</strong> to import the file back into Bfxr and continue
            working.
        </p>
        <h3>One step further with Audacity</h3>
        <p>
            There's one last thing I can share on this topic: modifying your WAV
            files with <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/">Audacity</a>
            (another free tool).
        </p>
        <p>There is a great deal of functionality within Audacity, much of
            which can be useful even at the novice skill level. Here are just
            some of the features it provides that can help you with your Bfxr
            sounds.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Advanced editing and mixing with copying, cutting, and pasting</li>
            <li>Noise removal</li>
            <li>Exporting to different file formats, such as AIFF, MP3, OGG,
                FLAC, WMA, AAC, and more
            </li>
            <li>Adjustments to pitch, tempo, and sampling rate</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I sought out Audacity to solve one particular issue I was having
            with Bfxr: little hidden sounds at the end of my clips. After
            exporting to WAV, I noticed my clips would play empty sound seconds
            after the audible sound was finished. So I used Audacity to clean
            this up.</p>
        <p>Here is an example.</p>
        <img class="imagePadding" src="images/1-audacity.png"
             alt="audacity application screenshot">
        <p>This is a shooting sound I created in Bfxr and loaded into
            Audacity. As you can see in the dark gray selected area to the
            right, from 1.060 seconds to 1.996 seconds there is no audible sound
            playing at all, yet it remains in the file. This is nearly one
            second of wasted play time. This will make the sound file larger and
            your sound engine do more work.</p>
        <p>So all you need to do to clean this up is select the area you
            would like to remove, delete it, and export the new sound. Easy to
            do, and worth the effort.</p>
        <h3>Wrapping up</h3>
        <p>If you made it this far, thanks for reading! I hope this helped
            you get started on making sound effects with Bfxr. If you have any
            questions, leave me a comment below.</p>
